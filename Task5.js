// Q1: What is the difference between var, let, and const?
//var can be redeclared and reassigned,let can be reassigned and but cannot redeclare const cannot be redeclare and reassigned

//### Q2: Can you re-declare a variable with var? What about let and const?

//yes we can redeclare a variable let and const we cannot redeclare

//### Q3: What is the output of this code?
//```javascript
//var x = 5;

//const z = 15;

//x = 20;
//y = 25;
//z = 30;

//console.log(x, y, z);

//there will be a error in the console because z was declared by using const

### Q4: What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?

//declaration means declaring a variable with out value is called declaration

//```javascript
//let a;
//console.log(a);

 //undefined

//### Q6: What is hoisting? Give an example

//certain declarations before excuting the code 
//console.log(x)
//x=10

//### Q7: What is the difference between null and undefined?
//undefined means value not assigned 
//null means empty value

//### Q8: What will be the output?
//javascript
//console.log(typeof null); object
//console.log(typeof undefined);undefned
//console.log(typeof []); object
//console.log(typeof {}); object




//## 📌 Operators (Questions 9-14)



### Q9: What is the difference between == and ===?

// console.log(10 > 5 && 20 < 10);
//console.log(!(10 > 5));


//### Q13: What will be the output?

//console.log(5 > 3 && 10 > 5);True
//console.log(5 > 10 || 10 > 5);True
//console.log(!(5 > 3));False


//### Q14: What is the ternary operator? Give an example.
//The ternary operator is short way of writing if else

//let age = 20;

//let result = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";

//console.log(result);

//## 📌 Type Casting (Questions 15-17)

//### Q15: What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?
//javascript converts automatically
//converts manually

//console.log(Number("123")); 123
//console.log(Number("hello")); Nan
//console.log(Number(true));1
//console.log(Number(false));0
//console.log(Boolean(0));false
//console.log(Boolean("hello"));true


//### Q17: What is NaN? Give an example.

//It is mathematcal operation cannot produce a numeric result
//let x = Number("hello");

//console.log(x);

//## 📌 Conditional Statements (Questions 18-21)

//### Q18: What is the difference between if-else and switch?

//if(age >= 18) {
 //   console.log("Adult");
//} else {
 //   console.log("Minor");
//}

//let day = 2;

//switch(day) {
    //case 1:
      //  console.log("Monday");
       // break;

    //case 2:
      //  console.log("Tuesday");
      //  break;

   // default:
       // console.log("Invalid");
//}

//### Q19: What will be the output?

//if(age >= 18) {
  //  console.log("Adult");
//} else {
  //  console.log("Minor");
//}
Adult

### Q20: What is nested if? Give an example.

//An if statement inside another if statement is called nested if.

//if(age >= 18) {

  //  if(hasID) {
    //    console.log("Entry allowed");
    //}

//}

//### Q21: Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using ternary operator.
